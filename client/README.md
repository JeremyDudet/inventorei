Okay, so this is my first re-write.

I'm porting this from Next.js -> React SPA and Express.js

I need to add:

- I need to implement auth.
- WebSockets. I want live feedback for when users input counts, invoices, and check items off the shopping list.
- I need to implement off-line mode.
- I need to implement client-side global state.
- I need to create a server with sql, and host it in cloudflare.
- I need to implement CRUD
